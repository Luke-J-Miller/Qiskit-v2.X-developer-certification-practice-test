# Qiskit-v2.X-developer-certification-practice-test
A short notebook with over 1000 questions for the qiskit developer certification.  Allows users to save their progress, study by full exam or selected target, and has adaptive study options.

## Quick start
1. Download the main [notebook](https://github.com/Luke-J-Miller/Qiskit-v2.X-developer-certification-practice-test/blob/main/qiskit-assoc-dev-practice-test%20(1).ipynb)
2. Download the necessary [files](https://github.com/Luke-J-Miller/Qiskit-v2.X-developer-certification-practice-test/tree/main/necessary_files)
3. Open the notebook
4. Specify the paths to the necessary files in the first cell.

5. Run all cells.  The notebook will walk you through it.  After every practice test, it will save your progress.  Provide the `student_history_xxxx.pkl` to continue where you left off.

## Q & A
** How complete is this? **
I tried to get fair coverage from the docs based on the study guide and sample tests.  Some of the tutorials were harder to parse than `en/guides/...` so I didn't include them.

** Did you include everything fromt the docs? **
No.  I made calls.  There are a lot of very rare gates, functions, parameters, etc that I didn't include.

** Are you open to comments, constructive criticism? **
Kinda. There are a few buggy questions--if someone wanted to correct the dataframe and pickle it, I'd replace it.  If someone wanted to expand the question base dataframe to include more circuit deconstruction ASCII's, that would also be cool.
