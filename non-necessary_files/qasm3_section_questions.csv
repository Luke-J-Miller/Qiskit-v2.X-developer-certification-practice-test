Which parameter in load/loads can expand circuits to a specified width for target backends?,num_qubits,include_path,basis_gates,experimental,num_qubits,`num_qubits` sets the number of physical/virtual qubits for the imported circuit.
What error can loads raise if the imported program uses more qubits than provided via num_qubits?,QASM3ExporterError,ValueError,TypeError,RuntimeError,ValueError,Docs state `loads()` may raise ValueError if program needs more qubits than `num_qubits`.
Which parameter for load/loads maps namespaces to serializers for annotations (requires qiskit_qasm3_import>=0.6.0)?,implicit_defcals,annotation_handlers,custom_gates,includes,annotation_handlers,The note states `annotation_handlers` requires qiskit_qasm3_import>=0.6.0.
Which pair are the **native experimental** import functions (Rust parser)?,load and loads,load_native and loads_native,load_experimental and loads_experimental,parse and parse_experimental,load_experimental and loads_experimental,These are faster but with reduced feature set; they emit ExperimentalWarning.
Which parameter supplies Python constructors for particular named gates to the experimental importer?,annotation_handlers,custom_gates,basis_gates,implicit_defcals,custom_gates,`custom_gates` is an iterable of `CustomGate` objects describing construction.
What does include_path do for the experimental importers?,Controls QASM indentation,Specifies search paths for include statements,Sets default qubit count,Selects exporter feature flags,Specifies search paths for include statements,`include_path` is an iterable of paths tried in order when resolving `include`.
Which attribute of CustomGate is the callable that returns a qiskit.circuit.Gate?,name,constructor,num_params,num_qubits,constructor,CustomGate.constructor is a callable taking `num_params` angles and returning a `Gate`.
What is qiskit.qasm3.STDGATES_INC_GATES?,A function to include stdgates,A tuple of CustomGate specs for stdgates.inc,A list of file paths,An enum of features,A tuple of CustomGate specs for stdgates.inc,It contains CustomGate objects mapping stdgates.inc names to Qiskit constructors.
What warning do the experimental importer functions emit by default?,ExperimentalWarning,DeprecationWarning,RuntimeWarning,UserWarning,ExperimentalWarning,Docs show how to filter `ExperimentalWarning` for `qiskit.qasm3`.
Which statement about Exporter aliasing parameters is correct?,alias_classical_registers overrides allow_aliasing,allow_aliasing overrides alias_classical_registers,They are identical,Neither affects output,allow_aliasing overrides alias_classical_registers,Docs: a value for `allow_aliasing` supersedes `alias_classical_registers`.
What does Exporter.implicit_defcals allow you to do?,Insert Pauli twirling,Specify defcal semantics for named instructions,Auto-generate measurement,Inline stdgates,Specify defcal semantics for named instructions,Maps Instruction.name to DefcalInstruction so exporter emits as if a `defcal` exists.
Which export call would **write** QASM 3 for `qc` to a file path `prog.qasm`?,"qasm3.dumps(qc, includes=['stdgates.inc'])","with open('prog.qasm','w') as f: qasm3.dump(qc, f)",qasm3.load('prog.qasm'),"qasm3.Exporter().dumps(qc, 'prog.qasm')","with open('prog.qasm','w') as f: qasm3.dump(qc, f)",`dump` needs a stream; open the file and pass the handle.
