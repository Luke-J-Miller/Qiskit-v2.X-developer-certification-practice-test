What is the default value of EstimatorOptions.default_precision?,0.015625,0.5,0.03125,None,0.015625,Default is 0.015625 which equals 1/sqrt(4096).
"Which option, if set, overrides default_precision for Estimator V2?",default_shots,resilience_level,seed_estimator,max_execution_time,default_shots,If default_shots is set it takes precedence over default_precision.
"In Estimator V2, a 'configuration' refers to what?",Combination of a parameter binding set and a physical measurement basis,Backend plus layout,Shots and seed settings,Number of circuits in the job,Combination of a parameter binding set and a physical measurement basis,A configuration pairs a specific parameter set with a commuting measurement basis.
"If Pauli twirling is enabled, how is default_shots applied?",Divided over circuit randomizations,Multiplied by noise factors,Assigned per extrapolator,Used only on the first PUB,Divided over circuit randomizations,Shots are split across randomizations when twirling is on.
What are the valid values and default for resilience_level in Estimator V2?,0 to 2; default 1,0 to 3; default 2,1 to 3; default 1,0 to 2; default 0,0 to 2; default 1,Resilience level ranges 0â€“2 and defaults to 1.
Which method updates Estimator V2 options?,update(),set_options(),configure(),apply(),update(),V2 options use the update() method instead of set_options().
What is the default for seed_estimator?,None,0,1,Unset is not allowed,None,Seed used to control sampling defaults to None.
The Estimator V2 options object is of which general Python type?,dataclass-based options,plain dict only,V1 Options class,tuple of key values,dataclass-based options,V2 primitives expose options as dataclasses (convertible with asdict).
What is the default ZNE noise amplifier technique?,gate_folding,gate_folding_front,pea,linear,gate_folding,Amplifier defaults to gate_folding unless changed.
"When amplifier='pea' is selected, which behavior is enforced?",Gate twirling is always used,Shots are doubled automatically,Linear extrapolator is forced,Noise factors are ignored,Gate twirling is always used,PEA requires and enforces gate twirling.
"For PEA, what are the default noise_factors?",(1 1.5 2),(1 3 5),(0 1 2),Depends only on extrapolator,(1 1.5 2),"PEA defaults to noise factors 1, 1.5, 2."
"If extrapolated_noise_factors is unset, what is used by default?",[0 and then noise_factors],Only noise_factors,[1 and then noise_factors],Computed from shots automatically,[0 and then noise_factors],"Defaults to [0, *noise_factors] for evaluation points."
Which extrapolator returns the raw value at the lowest noise factor without fitting?,fallback,linear,exponential,double_exponential,fallback,The 'fallback' extrapolator just returns the lowest-noise data.
Which fields are always in Estimator V2 results regardless of ZNE?,evs and stds,quasi_dists,counts,layout,evs and stds,Estimator V2 guarantees evs and stds in pub_result.data.
"With ZNE enabled, which additional fields can appear in pub_result.data?",evs_extrapolated and stds_extrapolated,quasi_dists and metadata,shots_per_randomization,layout_and_coupling_map,evs_extrapolated and stds_extrapolated,ZNE can return extrapolated values and related arrays.
"If multiple extrapolators are provided, which one determines the main evs and stds in the result?",The first extrapolator in the list,The last extrapolator,The average of all,The highest-degree polynomial,The first extrapolator in the list,evs and stds refer to the first specified extrapolator.
"If default_shots is None, what controls sampling effort by default?",default_precision,resilience_level,seed_estimator,execution.max_duration,default_precision,"When default_shots is not set, precision-based targeting via default_precision applies."
Where are advanced toggles for error mitigation in Estimator V2 located?,resilience options group,execution options group,environment options group,simulator options group,resilience options group,Fine-grained error-mitigation controls live under options.resilience.
Which options group controls submission and timing behavior?,execution,environment,resilience,experimental,execution,ExecutionOptionsV2 holds execution-time controls.
ZneOptions applies to which primitive according to the docs?,Estimator V2 only,Both Estimator and Sampler V2,Sampler V2 only,Neither primitive,Estimator V2 only,ZNE options are only used by the V2 Estimator.
