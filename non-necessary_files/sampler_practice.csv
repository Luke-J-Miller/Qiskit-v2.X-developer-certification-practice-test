Which class interfaces with the Qiskit Runtime Sampler primitive using the v2 interface?,qiskit_ibm_runtime.SamplerV1,qiskit_ibm_runtime.SamplerV2,qiskit.primitives.Sampler,qiskit_ibm_runtime.EstimatorV2,qiskit_ibm_runtime.SamplerV2,SamplerV2 is the v2 Runtime primitive client for sampling; it uses different I/O formats than v1.
What is the signature of the method used to submit work to the Sampler v2 service?,"run(circuits, shots)","run(pubs, *, shots=None)","execute(pubs, shots=None)","run(pubs, params=None, shots=None)","run(pubs, *, shots=None)",SamplerV2.run accepts an iterable of pub-like inputs and an optional keyword-only shots parameter.
What does SamplerV2.run return?,A PrimitiveResult directly,A RuntimeJobV2 whose result() returns PrimitiveResult,A list of Counts objects,"A tuple (job_id, result)",A RuntimeJobV2 whose result() returns PrimitiveResult,The call returns a RuntimeJobV2; calling result() yields a qiskit.primitives.containers.PrimitiveResult.
Which of the following are valid values for SamplerV2(mode=...)?,Only BackendV2,Only Session,"BackendV2, Session, or Batch",Only Batch,"BackendV2, Session, or Batch","Mode can be a Backend (job mode), a Session (session mode), or a Batch (batch mode)."
"If shots=None is passed to SamplerV2.run and the pub does not specify shots, what happens?",An error is raised,0 shots are used,The primitive's implementation default is used,It always uses 4096 shots,The primitive's implementation default is used,"When shots is None, the backend/runtime default is applied unless the pub overrides it."
Which option object groups configuration for the sampler primitive?,RuntimeOptions,SamplerOptions,BackendOptions,PrimitiveOptions,SamplerOptions,"SamplerOptions holds fields like default_shots, twirling, simulator, environment, execution, etc."
"According to the docs, what is the intended default for SamplerOptions.default_shots (when not otherwise specified in run or PUBs)?",1024,2048,4096,It has no default,4096,The attribute description states: 'Default: 4096'.
Which SamplerOptions sub-field configures Pauli twirling behavior?,execution,simulator,twirling,environment,twirling,Pauli twirling settings live under SamplerOptions.twirling (a TwirlingOptions object).
"By default for Sampler, TwirlingOptions.enable_gates is ____ and enable_measure is ____ .","True, True","True, False","False, False","False, True","False, False",Docs: enable_gates default False; enable_measure default False for Sampler (True for Estimator).
TwirlingOptions.strategy default value is which of the following?,'active','active-accum','active-circuit','all','active-accum',Strategy default is 'active-accum'.
"When TwirlingOptions.num_randomizations='auto' and shots_per_randomization is also 'auto', how is num_randomizations set?",ceil(32/shots),ceil(shots/64),ceil(shots/shots_per_randomization) after shots_per_randomization is derived,It is fixed to 32,ceil(shots/shots_per_randomization) after shots_per_randomization is derived,"Docs: first derive shots_per_randomization per its rule, then set num_randomizations=ceil(shots/shots_per_randomization)."
"When TwirlingOptions.shots_per_randomization='auto' and num_randomizations is also 'auto' (non-PEC case), what is the rule?","Set to min(64, ceil(shots/32))",Set to ceil(shots/num_randomizations),"Set to max(64, ceil(shots/32))",Set to 64 always,"Set to max(64, ceil(shots/32))","Docs: for non-PEC, shots_per_randomization defaults to max(64, ceil(shots/32)); PEC uses 64."
Which statement about default_shots vs num_randomizations*shots_per_randomization is correct?,default_shots always overrides,They are unrelated,The product of num_randomizations and shots_per_randomization takes precedence over default_shots,default_shots disables twirling,The product of num_randomizations and shots_per_randomization takes precedence over default_shots,Docs note: the interface obeys 'shots' in PUB/run; the twirling product overrides default_shots if both specified.
What does SamplerV2.backend() return?,A BackendV1,A BackendV2,A Session,A PrimitiveResult,A BackendV2,The helper returns the BackendV2 on which the primitive will run.
Which SamplerOptions method lets you modify options after construction?,set_options(**kwargs),configure(**kwargs),update(**kwargs),apply(**kwargs),update(**kwargs),SamplerOptions inherits an update(**kwargs) helper to change fields.
Which TwirlingOptions strategy twirls only qubits active in each individual 2â€‘qubit layer?,'all','active-circuit','active','active-accum','active',Strategy 'active' twirls only instruction qubits of the specific layer.
Which TwirlingOptions strategy twirls all qubits in the input circuit for each twirled layer?,'active-circuit','active','active-accum','all','all',Docs: 'all' twirls all qubits every twirled layer.
What kinds of objects can be placed in the iterable 'pubs' for SamplerV2.run?,Only circuits without parameters,"Only (circuit, parameter_values) tuples","Pub-like objects such as circuits or (circuit, parameter_values) tuples",Only transpiled circuits,"Pub-like objects such as circuits or (circuit, parameter_values) tuples","Docs state an iterable of pub-like objects; circuits or (circuit, parameter_values) are examples."
Which field in SamplerOptions controls classical runtime environment settings like variables?,execution,environment,experimental,simulator,environment,SamplerOptions.environment is an EnvironmentOptions object for environment configuration.
Complete the statement: The SamplerV2 class 'uses different input and output formats than version 1'. What is implied for migration?,No changes are needed; it is drop-in,You must adapt code to v2 primitive I/O expectations,Only backend names change,Only shots handling changes,You must adapt code to v2 primitive I/O expectations,"The docs highlight that v2 uses different I/O formats compared to v1, so migration may require changes."
