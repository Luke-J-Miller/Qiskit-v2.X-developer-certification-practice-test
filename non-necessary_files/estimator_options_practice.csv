What is the default value of default_precision?,0.015625 (1 / sqrt(4096)),0.03125 (1 / 32),0.0025 (1 / 400),Unset (no default),0.015625 (1 / sqrt(4096)),"Docs specify default_precision defaults to 0.015625, which equals 1/√4096."
"If default_shots is set, how does it interact with default_precision?",default_shots overrides default_precision,default_precision overrides default_shots,Both are averaged,They are ignored if shots are given in PUB,default_shots overrides default_precision,The note explicitly says default_shots overrides default_precision when set.
What is the default value of default_shots?,None,1024,4096,UnsetType,None,default_shots defaults to None per the attribute description.
"In EstimatorOptions, what does 'configuration' refer to for default_shots?",A combination of a specific parameter binding and a physical measurement basis,Only the number of classical registers in the circuit,A backend configuration JSON,The transpilation layout only,A combination of a specific parameter binding and a physical measurement basis,A configuration groups a parameter set with a measurement basis into a single hardware execution grouping.
"If Pauli twirling is enabled, how are default_shots used?",They are divided across circuit randomizations,They are multiplied by the number of randomizations,Twirling disables shots,Shots are ignored and precision is used,They are divided across circuit randomizations,The docs state the value will be divided over circuit randomizations when twirling is enabled.
What is the default value of resilience_level in EstimatorOptions?,1,0,2,Unset (no default),1,Resilience level defaults to 1 per the attribute description.
Which resilience_level statement is TRUE for EstimatorOptions?,Level 0 means no mitigation,Level 1 uses ZNE,Level 2 is guaranteed unbiased,Level 2 disables readout mitigation,Level 0 means no mitigation,The table notes: 0 no mitigation; 1 minimal cost/readout mitigation; 2 medium cost (not guaranteed zero bias).
Which option controls RNG behavior for sampling in Estimator V2?,seed_estimator,seed_simulator,seed_transpiler,seed_runtime,seed_estimator,seed_estimator is the documented option to control sampling; defaults to None.
What is the default value of seed_estimator?,None,0,1,Random per job,None,The attribute explicitly lists Default: None.
Which statement best describes the 'Unset' value for options?,"If an option is Unset, server defaults are used",Unset means zero,Unset blocks job submission,Unset falls back to V1 defaults,"If an option is Unset, server defaults are used",V2 options use Unset to defer to server-side defaults.
Which of the following is NOT directly an EstimatorOptions field?,optimization_level,default_precision,resilience_level,twirling,optimization_level,V2 primitives removed optimization_level from options; others are valid fields.
Which attribute provides advanced toggles to fine‑tune mitigation methods?,resilience (ResilienceOptionsV2),execution (ExecutionOptionsV2),environment (EnvironmentOptions),simulator (SimulatorOptions),resilience (ResilienceOptionsV2),The 'resilience' sub-options let you fine-tune the strategy beyond the top-level level knob.
How do you update multiple EstimatorOptions fields after initialization?,"Use options.update(key=value, ...)",Use set_options(),Recreate the Estimator,Modify backend.configuration(),"Use options.update(key=value, ...)",V2 uses a dataclass options object with an update(**kwargs) method; set_options() is V1.
"If you pass a precision argument to EstimatorV2.run(...), which precision applies?",The run() precision applies to PUBs that don’t specify their own,default_precision always overrides run(),PUB precision is ignored,The smallest precision wins,The run() precision applies to PUBs that don’t specify their own,Docs: run() precision is used for PUBs lacking their own precision; PUB-level precision still possible.
Which pair correctly matches a suboption container to its purpose?,execution → execution-time options,resilience → simulator tuning,twirling → environment variables,environment → Pauli twirling controls,execution → execution-time options,ExecutionOptionsV2 covers execution-time options; twirling covers Pauli twirling; environment is separate.
What is true about EstimatorOptions.twirling?,It configures Pauli twirling and interacts with shots via randomizations,It enables resilience level 3 by default,It only applies on simulators,It replaces readout error mitigation,It configures Pauli twirling and interacts with shots via randomizations,TwirlingOptions controls Pauli twirling; shots are divided across randomizations when enabled.
Which statement about EstimatorOptions.default_shots is correct?,It is the total shots per circuit per configuration,It is the total shots per entire job across all PUBs,It must always be a positive int; None is invalid,It is always ignored on hardware,It is the total shots per circuit per configuration,The attribute text defines it per circuit per configuration (parameter set × measurement basis).
What is the base class of EstimatorOptions per the docs?,OptionsV2,BaseEstimatorV2,RuntimeOptions,PrimitiveOptions,OptionsV2,The page states: Bases: OptionsV2.
Which statement best describes EstimatorOptions.simulator?,Holds simulator-specific suboptions via SimulatorOptions,Sets the Aer backend automatically,Only available in V1,Stores the seed for random circuits,Holds simulator-specific suboptions via SimulatorOptions,The simulator field is a suboptions container (SimulatorOptions | Dict).
Which of the following is TRUE about EstimatorOptions.execution?,It holds execution time options via ExecutionOptionsV2,It sets transpiler optimization level,It toggles device coupling maps,It configures measurement bases,It holds execution time options via ExecutionOptionsV2,The execution suboptions are documented as ExecutionOptionsV2.
Resilience level 1 primarily focuses on which mitigation?,Readout error mitigation (minimal cost),Zero-noise extrapolation only,PEC with unbiased results,No mitigation,Readout error mitigation (minimal cost),Resilience level 1 is minimal-cost mitigation mainly addressing readout errors.
Resilience level 2 is characterized by:,Medium mitigation costs; typically reduces bias but not guaranteed zero bias,Guaranteed zero bias regardless of depth,Turning off all mitigation,Only measurement twirling,Medium mitigation costs; typically reduces bias but not guaranteed zero bias,Docs state level 2 typically reduces bias but is not guaranteed unbiased.
What is the recommended way to set many options at once in V2?,Pass a dict at construction or call options.update(**kwargs),Call set_options(),Modify job.metadata,Edit backend.defaults(),Pass a dict at construction or call options.update(**kwargs),V2 supports dict at init and options.update later; set_options is V1-only.
