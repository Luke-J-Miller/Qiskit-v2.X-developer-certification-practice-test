Which class represents a V2 primitive execution and is returned by SamplerV2/EstimatorV2 run calls?,RuntimeJobV2,PrimitiveJob,JobV1,BaseRuntimeJob,RuntimeJobV2,The docs define RuntimeJobV2 as the representation of a runtime V2 primitive execution.
What does RuntimeJobV2.status() return?,A string literal status such as 'RUNNING',A JobStatus enum,An integer code,A boolean indicating if done,A string literal status such as 'RUNNING',"status() returns a Literal among 'INITIALIZING','QUEUED','RUNNING','CANCELLED','DONE','ERROR'."
Which of the following is NOT in RuntimeJobV2.JOB_FINAL_STATES?,INITIALIZING,DONE,CANCELLED,ERROR,INITIALIZING,"Final states are ('DONE','CANCELLED','ERROR'); 'INITIALIZING' is not final."
"If you want to check whether a job has reached any terminal status, which method should you call?",in_final_state(),done(),cancelled(),errored(),in_final_state(),in_final_state() returns True when the job is in a final state such as DONE or ERROR.
What does RuntimeJobV2.done() specifically indicate?,The job has successfully run,The job has been cancelled,The job is still queued,The job encountered an error,The job has successfully run,done() returns True when the job completed successfully.
Which method returns a boolean indicating whether the job failed?,errored(),cancelled(),in_final_state(),running(),errored(),errored() returns True if the job failed.
What does RuntimeJobV2.cancelled() return when a job was cancelled?,True,False,A string 'CANCELLED',Raises an exception,True,cancelled() returns a boolean indicating if the job has been cancelled.
Calling RuntimeJobV2.logs() before a job finishes willâ€¦,Not return logs because logs are only available after the job finishes,Return partial logs,Raise RuntimeJobTimeoutError,Return an empty string,Not return logs because logs are only available after the job finishes,The docs note logs are only available after completion.
Which method raises RuntimeJobFailureError if the job failed when retrieving outputs?,result(),metrics(),backend(),properties(),result(),"result(timeout=None, decoder=None) returns job results and raises RuntimeJobFailureError on failure."
Which argument can you supply to result() to customize decoding of the results?,decoder (a ResultDecoder subclass),formatter (a Formatter subclass),parser (a JSONParser subclass),serializer (a Serializer subclass),decoder (a ResultDecoder subclass),result() accepts a 'decoder' parameter to decode job results.
What does RuntimeJobV2.usage() return?,Job usage in seconds as a float,Number of shots as an int,CPU core seconds as an int,A dict with 'timestamps',Job usage in seconds as a float,usage() returns job usage in seconds.
Which attribute provides an estimate of QPU time (quantum_seconds) for the job?,usage_estimation,usage,metrics,properties,usage_estimation,usage_estimation returns estimated system execution time (quantum_seconds).
The image property returns what string format when a custom runtime image is used?,image_name:tag,repository@sha256:digest,Only the tag,A JSON with name and tag,image_name:tag,image() returns 'image_name:tag' or empty string if default image is used.
What does RuntimeJobV2.backend(timeout=None) return on success?,A Backend object or None,A Provider,Only the backend name string,A JobV1,A Backend object or None,"backend() returns the Backend used, re-fetching if needed; may be None."
Which method polls until the job reaches a terminal state and can raise RuntimeJobTimeoutError?,wait_for_final_state(),in_final_state(),status(),done(),wait_for_final_state(),wait_for_final_state(timeout=None) polls status until a final state or timeout.
How do you update the tags associated with a job?,update_tags(new_tags),set_options(tags=new_tags),properties(tags=new_tags),status(tags=new_tags),update_tags(new_tags),update_tags(List[str]) assigns new tags and returns them; errors bubble as IBMApiError.
What does the properties(refresh=False) method return?,"BackendProperties used when the job started, or None",The current live backend properties only,A dict of job inputs,A list of tags,"BackendProperties used when the job started, or None",properties() returns backend properties at the job start (cached unless refresh=True).
What type does creation_date return?,A datetime in local time or None,A UTC timestamp string only,An epoch integer,Always a datetime in UTC,A datetime in local time or None,creation_date returns a datetime object converted to local time or None if unavailable.
Which call returns the IBM Cloud instance CRN the job used?,instance,backend,primitive_id,usage,instance,The instance attribute returns the IBM Cloud instance CRN.
What does the inputs attribute of RuntimeJobV2 provide?,Job input parameters,The job logs,Backend configuration,Primitive metadata only,Job input parameters,inputs exposes the parameters used to run the job.
"If a job is cancelled and you call result(), which error can be raised?",RuntimeInvalidStateError,IBMApiError,RuntimeJobFailureError,RuntimeJobTimeoutError,RuntimeInvalidStateError,result() may raise RuntimeInvalidStateError when attempting to get results of a cancelled job.
Which method returns 'timestamps' and 'usage' among other keys in a dictionary?,metrics(),usage_estimation(),usage(),logs(),metrics(),metrics() returns job metrics including timestamps and usage details.
Which attribute tells you whether a job is private?,private,tags,session_id,image,private,The 'private' attribute indicates whether the job is marked private.
What does the session_id attribute return for simulator backends?,None,The backend name,An empty string,A random UUID,None,Docs state it returns None if the backend is a simulator.
Which status indicates the job is actively executing?,RUNNING,QUEUED,INITIALIZING,DONE,RUNNING,RUNNING indicates active execution.
Which method returns True only while the job is actively executing (not queued or done)?,running(),done(),in_final_state(),cancelled(),running(),running() returns whether the job is actively running.
Which method lets you retrieve error details if the job failed?,error_message(),usage(),backend(),logs(),error_message(),"error_message() returns the reason string if the job failed, or None."
