How are multiple observables and parameter sets combined within a single PUB in V2 primitives?,By NumPy broadcasting rules,By Cartesian product expansion coded manually,By repeating the circuit explicitly in the input list,By automatic outer join of counts,By NumPy broadcasting rules,The guide states that NumPy broadcasting rules are used to combine observables and parameter values.
What does Sampler V2 return for measurement outcomes?,Per-shot bitstrings organized by classical register name,Quasi-probability distributions,Statevectors for each shot,Expectation values and variances,Per-shot bitstrings organized by classical register name,Sampler V2 focuses on sampling and returns per-shot bitstrings; V1 returned quasi-dists.
Which convenience method is mentioned for Sampler V2 results?,get_counts(),get_quasi_probs(),get_statevector(),get_expectation_values(),get_counts(),Sampler V2 includes convenience methods like `get_counts()`.
"If you used `measure_all()` and did not create custom ClassicalRegisters, what is the default classical register name in Sampler V2 results?",meas,c,creg,out,meas,The docs specify the default classical register is named `meas`.
What kind of circuits and observables do V2 primitives accept?,Only ISA-compliant objects supported by the target backend,Any Qiskit circuit; transpilation is done inside the primitive,Only ideal statevector circuits,Only circuits with no classical registers,Only ISA-compliant objects supported by the target backend,V2 primitives do not perform layout/routing/translation; inputs must match the backend ISA.
Who is responsible for transpiling circuits for V2 primitives?,The user (outside the primitive),The primitive automatically transpiles,The backend does implicit transpilation at runtime,No transpilation is needed for V2,The user (outside the primitive),The guide points to the transpilation docs; primitives do not transpile.
"In Estimator V2, what appears in the PubResult data?",Expectation values and standard errors (stds),Expectation values and variances,Quasi-probabilities and counts,Only expectation values; no errors,Expectation values and standard errors (stds),The data portion contains expectation values and standard errors; V1 had variance in metadata.
Which statement about resilience levels is true for Sampler V2?,Sampler V2 does not support resilience levels,Sampler V2 supports levels 0–2,Sampler V2 supports level 3 only,Sampler V2 uses optimization_level to set resilience,Sampler V2 does not support resilience levels,The guide explicitly states Sampler V2 returns raw samples and does not support resilience levels.
Which resilience levels are supported by Estimator V2?,0–2,0–3,Only 2,Only 1–3,0–2,Estimator V2 supports levels 0–2 and removes level 3 (PEC only via explicit option).
Which of the following about `optimization_level` is correct?,Sampler V2 does not support it; Estimator V2 will drop it around 30 Sep 2024,Both Sampler V2 and Estimator V2 require optimization_level,Estimator V2 requires optimization_level = 2,Sampler V2 uses optimization_level to pick shots,Sampler V2 does not support it; Estimator V2 will drop it around 30 Sep 2024,"Per the docs, Sampler V2 doesn't support it; Estimator V2 will drop support on/around 30 Sep 2024."
How do you update options in V2 primitives after initialization?,Use the `.options.update(...)` method or assign dataclass fields,Call `.set_options(...)` on the primitive,Recreate the primitive; options are immutable,Use `.configure(...)` on the backend,Use the `.options.update(...)` method or assign dataclass fields,V2 options are dataclasses; you can bulk-update via `update()` or assign fields directly.
What happens if you don’t set a particular V2 primitive option?,It is `Unset` and server defaults are used,It errors at runtime,It silently assumes zero,It reuses the last option set on the session,It is `Unset` and server defaults are used,The docs state unset options receive a special `Unset` value and server defaults apply.
What does `RuntimeJobV2.status()` return?,"A string (e.g., 'RUNNING')",A `JobStatus` enum,A boolean,"A tuple of (state, reason)","A string (e.g., 'RUNNING')","The new `RuntimeJobV2` returns a string, not the Qiskit JobStatus enum."
How can you specify shots in Sampler V2?,"Either via the `run(..., shots=...)` argument or inside each PUB tuple",Only via primitive initialization options,Only via backend configuration,Shots are not used; V2 infers them,"Either via the `run(..., shots=...)` argument or inside each PUB tuple",Docs show shots in `run()` and optionally per-PUB as the third tuple element.
You create custom ClassicalRegisters named 'alpha' and 'beta'. How do you access their counts in a Sampler V2 PubResult?,pub_result.data.alpha.get_counts() and pub_result.data.beta.get_counts(),pub_result.data.meas.get_counts() only,pub_result.alpha and pub_result.beta,"pub_result.get_counts('alpha','beta')",pub_result.data.alpha.get_counts() and pub_result.data.beta.get_counts(),The example prints counts for `alpha` and `beta` via `pub_result.data.<reg>.get_counts()`.
"To convert Sampler V2 counts to the V1 quasi-probability format, what should you do?",Divide counts by the number of shots to get quasi-probabilities,Multiply counts by the number of shots,Normalize by maximum count only,Convert bitstrings to integers; counts remain raw,Divide counts by the number of shots to get quasi-probabilities,The docs show dividing by shots (and converting string bitkeys to ints) to match V1 quasi-dists.
What new argument can Estimator V2 take to control estimate accuracy?,precision,resilience_level,optimization_level,twirling_strategy,precision,Estimator V2 adds a `precision` argument (either in PUB or `run()`).
Why might session-based examples error on the Open Plan?,Open Plan workloads can run only in job or batch mode,Sessions are unsupported on any backend,Sessions require GPU access,Sessions require Estimator V1,Open Plan workloads can run only in job or batch mode,"The guide cautions that sessions aren’t available on Open Plan, which supports job/batch modes only."
"After V1 support ends, what does `from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Sampler` import?",The V2 Sampler,It raises an ImportError,The legacy V1 Sampler,A stub that warns but does nothing,The V2 Sampler,"Warning box states that after V1 deprecation, `import <primitive>` will import the V2 version."
How are results grouped in V2 jobs with multiple PUBs?,By PUB; index the job.result() list to access each PUB’s PubResult,By circuit name globally,All concatenated into a flat array of numbers,By backend queue position,By PUB; index the job.result() list to access each PUB’s PubResult,The examples repeatedly access `job.result()[i]` per PUB.
What is the stated design focus of Sampler V2 compared to V1?,Focus on sampling per-shot outputs without weights,Provide built-in quasi-probabilities with mitigation,Return expectation values for observables,Perform transpilation automatically,Focus on sampling per-shot outputs without weights,The overview says Sampler V2 focuses on sampling and returns unweighted samples.
